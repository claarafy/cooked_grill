									It is highly recommended for customers to leave a phone number when placing their order. This is especially
									helpful when the meal is being delivered to the customer. Please make sure all delevery and pickup addresses
									are complete and accurate. Please send out an email if special instructions are required for a delivery and pickup.
									Please allow a 15 minute grace period for all deliveries and pickups.
